# Hi, Have You met Victor.
Hey! I'm still new to this. Just on here to learn.

# My Career Passions
I'm currently in the military self teaching myself how to code. Hope to get out soon and get a degree in CS. Still trying to figure out what path I'm into, but I'm leaning towards machine learning. Right now I only know python.  I'd say I'm pretty efficient at it, could be better though.

# My hobbies
I don't really have many hobbies. I like to travel with good company. I play Apex, hit me up if you're trying to squad up.

# Favorite Books
Some of my favorite books are Python Crash Course and Endgame.
